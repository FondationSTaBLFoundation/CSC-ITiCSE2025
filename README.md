## Introduction
We propose a new concurrency framework called *Communicating StateCharts (CSC)* with the potential to simplify the teaching concurrency to beginners. CSC was designed based on five main principles chosen to reduce barriers for beginners: using software visualization, Model-Driven Development (MDD), pure functions, Separation of Concerns (SoC), and---most importantly---raising the level of abstraction. To address these principles, we adopted features from existing concurrency models (i.e., process calculi and the actor model) in alignment with the principles, resulting in CSC's atomic statecharts, communicating through channels.
Synchronization in CSC happens through separating the program into Local (private to each user) and Global (synchronized among every client connected to the server).
This is based on the [Local-Global Model-View-Update (LG-MVU)](http://hdl.handle.net/11375/31494) architecture.

We also present *CSCDraw*, a visual MDD tool to support CSC.
CSCDraw has two modes:
1. **Overall Mode:** The overall mode illustrates
the channels connected to a statechartsâ€™ interfaces, with the model
contents including states, transitions, and synchronizing messages. 
This view allows message specification and
code generation.

2. **SCEditing mode:** In this mode, the states and
transitions within a statechart can be edited.

## Try at Home!

To try designing a multi-user application with our visual model-driven development tool, CSCDraw, please:

1. download the [Try at Home Package](TryAtHome.rar) locally on your device. 
    - If you are facing any troubles with opening the package, please download these files manually: [CSCDraw](CSCDraw.html), [Party Game](#party-game), and [Lights Game](#lights-game).
2. click on CSCDraw.html on your device to open it with your browser.

Then, you can either
- try using our pre-designed multi-player games by
    1. clicking on the upload button <img src="Graphics/upload.png" alt="upload button" width="50"/>, and then 
    2. choosing one of the pre-designed CSCs from the [Try at Home Package](TryAtHome.rar), such as [Party Game](#party-game) or [Lights Game](#lights-game). 
        - To find a detailed decription of the examples, please consult the [CSC Examples](#csc-examples) section.
    3. generating code based on the designed models by clicking on the code generator button <img src="Graphics/CodeGen.png" alt="code generator" width="40"/>. 
    4. copying the generated code by `CTRL/CMD + A` and `CTRL/CMD + C`.
    5. Compile the generated code on our online IDE, [STaBL.rocks](https://stabl.rocks/).
        - Section [Introduction to Our Online IDE](#introduction-to-our-online-ide) provides a detailed explanation of how to run your generated code on our online IDE.

, or

- design your own multi-user applications, by
    1. clicking on a statechart and navigating to the SCEditing mode.
    2. going back to the overall mode and designing the other statechart. 
        - Navigation from SCEditing mode to the Overall mode is possible by clicking on the navigator button <img src="Graphics/Navigator.png" alt="navigator button" width="40"/>.

    3. connecting messages to the channels in the Overall mode.
    4. generating code based on the designed models by clicking on the code generator <img src="Graphics/CodeGen.png" alt="code generator" width="40"/>. 
    5. copying the generated code by `CTRL/CMD + A` and `CTRL/CMD + C`.
    6. saving the designed model locally by clicking on the save button <img src="Graphics/save.png" alt="save button" width="40"/> (optional).
    7. Compile the generated code on our online IDE, [STaBL.rocks](https://stabl.rocks/).
        - Section [Introduction to Our Online IDE](#introduction-to-our-online-ide) provides a detailed explanation of how to run your generated code on our online IDE.






### CSC Examples


#### Party Game
The Party game is a multiplayer game that requires players to manage
their money to go to a party. In particular, the party will start only if at
least three players successfully arrive at the PartyRoom. If a player fails
to manage their money, then the party will be cancelled.

The [Party Game](PartyGame\PartyGame.json) can be found [here](https://stabl.rocks/ShowTeasyncServerClient?teasyncServerId=0e4eba0f-79a2-414b-abac-c30f2adfb68e).


#### Lights Game
This game is a very simple example of a CSC design to show how [synchronization](#introduction) happens in CSC.
This idea of this multi-player game is that when
a player hovers over a button it will light up only for them, 
and when they click on a button, it will switch ON/OFF
the lights for everybody connected to the server (global).

The [Lights game](LightsGame\LightsGameCSC.json) can be found [here](https://stabl.rocks/ShowTeasyncServerClient?teasyncServerId=b110fe0e-259c-46e8-8ec5-d365e5c03f7f).



### Introduction to Our Online IDE

If you don't have an account on [STaBL.rocks](https://stabl.rocks/), please contact either [Sheida](emdadibz@mcmaster.ca) or [Dr. Anand](anandc@mcmaster.ca).

After generating the code in CSCDraw, please log into your account on [STaBL.rocks](https://stabl.rocks/), and then follow these steps:
1. Choose `My Projects` tab.
2. Click on the `+New` button.
3. Create a project using `TEASync` template.
4. Open your created project.
5. Open the Types module.
6. Paste the generated code by `CTRL/CMD + V`.
7. Cut (`CTRL/CMD + X`) the code that belongs to the Main module. 
    - Look for this comment `--Put this code into the Main module.` in the generated code, then select and cut the code from this comment (by `CTRL/CMD + X`).
8. Before pasting the cut code, in the same module (Types) compile the code by clicking on the compile button <img src="Graphics/compile.png" alt="compile button" width="40"/>.
9. Click on the `Release button in the Types module <img src="Graphics/Release.png" alt="release button" width="70"/>.
10. In your Project's page (where you can see the Main and Types modules), click on the `Generate Codec` button <img src="Graphics/Codec.png" alt="codec button" width="70"/>.
The Project's page looks like:
    <img src="Graphics/modules.png" alt="modules mode" width="500"/>
    - If the encoders and decoders are successfully generated, you will see a confirmation like this:
        `Successfully generated new Codec.Decoders and Codec.Encoders modules.`
11. Open the Main module.
12. Paste the rest of the generated code starting from the comment `--Put this code into the Main module.`.
13. Click on the compile button on the top left corner <img src="Graphics/compile.png" alt="compile button" width="40"/>, and see the output on the right pane.
